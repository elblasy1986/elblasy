            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

            <p>Last updated: February 2026</p>

            <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By accessing and playing World Clickers, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not
                agree to these terms, please do not use the game.</p>

            <h2>Game Description</h2>
            <p>World Clickers is a free-to-play browser-based idle clicker game where players mine resources, earn
                virtual currency, and compete on global leaderboards. The game is provided "as is" for entertainment
                purposes.</p>

            <h2>Virtual Currency & In-Game Items</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Virtual Resources:</strong> Resources mined and country/player values generated in-game are
                    strictly virtual and have no real-world monetary value. They cannot be exchanged for real currency.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Tool Purchases:</strong> Tools and upgrades are purchased using real-world currency through
                    our trusted payment gateways. These items are virtual goods that enhance gameplay.</li>
                <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> All in-game purchases are final and non-refundable, except as required
                    by applicable law.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Payments & Transactions</h2>
            <p>World Clickers uses trusted third-party payment gateways to process transactions. We do not directly
                store your payment instrument details. By making a purchase, you agree to our pricing terms and
                authorize the charge.</p>

            <h2>Player Conduct</h2>
            <p>Players agree to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play the game fairly without using scripts, bots, or automated tools</li>
                <li>Not attempt to manipulate leaderboards or game data</li>
                <li>Not interfere with other players' experience</li>
                <li>Adhere to the game's rate limit of 10 clicks per second to maintain service stability</li>
                <li>Not attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or modify the game code for malicious purposes</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Leaderboards</h2>
            <p>Leaderboard data is for entertainment purposes. We reserve the right to remove or reset leaderboard
                entries at our discretion, including entries suspected of cheating or manipulation.</p>

            <p>All content within World Clickers — including but not limited to graphics, sounds, game mechanics, and
                text — is protected by intellectual property laws. You may not reproduce, distribute, or create
                derivative works without explicit permission.</p>

                not guarantee uninterrupted service. Your game progress, scores, and purchase history are stored
                securely on our online databases to ensure cross-device consistency.</p>

            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>In no event shall the creators of World Clickers be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or
                consequential damages arising from the use of or inability to use the game.</p>

            <h2>Modifications</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Continued use of the game after
                changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
